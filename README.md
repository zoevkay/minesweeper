## Minesweeper

Classic version:
The rules in Minesweeper are simple: Uncover a mine, and the game ends. Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing. Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding squaresâ€”information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.

Good luck!
